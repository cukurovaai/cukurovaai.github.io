abstract = {Solar radiation (SR) is an important data for various applications such as climate, energy and engineering. Because of this, determination and estimation of temporal and spatial variability of SR has critical importance in order to make plans and organizations for the present and the future. In this study, a deep learning method is employed for estimating the SR over 30 stations located in Turkey. The astronomical factor, extraterrestrial radiation and climatic variables, sunshine duration, cloud cover, minimum temperature and maximum temperature were used as input attributes and the output was obtained as SR. The datasets of 34 stations, spanning the dates from 2001 to 2007, were used for training and testing the model, respectively, and simulated values were compared with ground-truth values. The overall coefficient of determination, root mean square error and mean absolute error were calculated as 0.980, 0.78 MJm−2day−1 and 0.61 MJm−2day−1, respectively. Consequently, DL model has yielded very precise and comparable results for estimating daily global SR. These results are generally better than or they are comparable to many previous studies reported in literature, so one can conclude that the method can be a good alternative and be successfully applied to similar regions.}

abstract = {This study is based on the simulation for the position resolution performances of a sampling electromagnetic calorimeter with a Peroxide-cured polysiloxane based scintillator as an active material. Various algorithms and corrections were applied to reconstruct hit positions. Energy deposition in the center tower and neighboring towers were used to reconstruct the beam impact position in a detector tower module consisted of a 3 x 3 array matrix. Linear weights, corrected linear weights, logarithmic weights, and corrected logarithmic weights were the different algorithms to reconstruct beam hit positions through energy weighted tower positions. Moreover, the iterative weighting method based on the logarithmic weights were applied. The re-weighting algorithm based on the iterative weighting method was seen to improve the results necessarily at relatively low beam energies. Additionally, deep neural network structures were applied over the linear weights without using any logarithmic weights or correction to improve the position resolutions.}

abstract = {Spatiotemporal time series prediction plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications. However, in most of the studies, spatial information was ignored and predictions were carried out either on a few points or on average values. In this study, 37 different configurations of 4 traditional ML models and 3 Neural Network (NN) based models were utilized to provide a comprehensive comparison and evaluate the spatiotemporal data prediction capabilities of the ML models. Additionally, to reveal the importance of spatial data for the time series prediction process, the best configuration of each ML model was evaluated with and without using spatial information. The utilized models were: (i) Linear Regression (LR), (ii) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), (iii) Decision-Trees (DT), (iv) Support Vector Machine (SVM), (v) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), (vi) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and (vii) Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The study was performed on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data collected by satellite radiometers via infrared measurements. The models were evaluated according to their one-month ahead spatiotemporal SST prediction performance over the southern coasts of Turkey, and the effects of spatial information on model performance were presented. Results reveal that the spatial information increased the prediction performance by approximately 25%, in terms of RMSE. Additionally, acquired results show that the LSTM model outperforms all other ML models and gives the smallest prediction errors in all metrics.}

ABSTRACT = {This study tested whether machine learning (ML) methods can effectively separate individual plants from complex 3D canopy laser scans as a prerequisite to analyzing particular plant features. For this, we scanned mung bean and chickpea crops with PlantEye (R) laser scanners. Firstly, we segmented the crop canopies from the background in 3D space using the Region Growing Segmentation algorithm. Then, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based ML algorithms were fine-tuned for plant counting. Application of the CNN-based (Convolutional Neural Network) processing architecture was possible only after we reduced the dimensionality of the data to 2D. This allowed for the identification of individual plants and their counting with an accuracy of 93.18% and 92.87% for mung bean and chickpea plants, respectively. These steps were connected to the phenotyping pipeline, which can now replace manual counting operations that are inefficient, costly, and error-prone. The use of CNN in this study was innovatively solved with dimensionality reduction, addition of height information as color, and consequent application of a 2D CNN-based approach. We found there to be a wide gap in the use of ML on 3D information. This gap will have to be addressed, especially for more complex plant feature extractions, which we intend to implement through further research.},

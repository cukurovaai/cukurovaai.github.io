abstract = {Solar radiation (SR) is an important data for various applications such as climate, energy and engineering. Because of this, determination and estimation of temporal and spatial variability of SR has critical importance in order to make plans and organizations for the present and the future. In this study, a deep learning method is employed for estimating the SR over 30 stations located in Turkey. The astronomical factor, extraterrestrial radiation and climatic variables, sunshine duration, cloud cover, minimum temperature and maximum temperature were used as input attributes and the output was obtained as SR. The datasets of 34 stations, spanning the dates from 2001 to 2007, were used for training and testing the model, respectively, and simulated values were compared with ground-truth values. The overall coefficient of determination, root mean square error and mean absolute error were calculated as 0.980, 0.78 MJm−2day−1 and 0.61 MJm−2day−1, respectively. Consequently, DL model has yielded very precise and comparable results for estimating daily global SR. These results are generally better than or they are comparable to many previous studies reported in literature, so one can conclude that the method can be a good alternative and be successfully applied to similar regions.},

abstract = {This study is based on the simulation for the position resolution performances of a sampling electromagnetic calorimeter with a Peroxide-cured polysiloxane based scintillator as an active material. Various algorithms and corrections were applied to reconstruct hit positions. Energy deposition in the center tower and neighboring towers were used to reconstruct the beam impact position in a detector tower module consisted of a 3 x 3 array matrix. Linear weights, corrected linear weights, logarithmic weights, and corrected logarithmic weights were the different algorithms to reconstruct beam hit positions through energy weighted tower positions. Moreover, the iterative weighting method based on the logarithmic weights were applied. The re-weighting algorithm based on the iterative weighting method was seen to improve the results necessarily at relatively low beam energies. Additionally, deep neural network structures were applied over the linear weights without using any logarithmic weights or correction to improve the position resolutions.}
